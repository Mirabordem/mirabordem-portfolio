I am a tech enthusiast and seasoned artist passionate about problem-solving through innovation. Technology, for me, is not just a tool but a medium for creation. I approach coding as an art form, sculpting impactful applications with precision and passion. As a lifetime Yogi, who at the same time continuously embraces new technologies and innovative solutions, I bring a holistic approach to my work, finding inspiration in nature.

As an exhibited and awarded sculptor, I aim to create value and meaning where it didn't exist before, merging art and technology to build extraordinary products. Together, we can build applications that go beyond the ordinary. Eager to learn and tackle new challenges, bring fresh perspectives, I'm a coder and I'm an artist shaping the future, one line of code at a time.
